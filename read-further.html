                <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Rice:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Meat and Vegetables:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a traditional Uzbek kazan, heat the vegetable oil or lamb fat over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the onions and cook until they are golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Add the meat and cook until browned on all sides.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the carrots and cook for another 5 minutes until they start to soften.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Add Spices and Flavor:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, paprika, black pepper, and salt to the pot. Stir well to coat the meat and vegetables with the spices.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic cloves, raisins, and chickpeas (if using), and mix them into the pot.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Layer the Rice:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spread the soaked and drained rice evenly over the meat and vegetables in the pot. Do not stir.</li>
                    <li>Pour the water gently over the rice to cover it by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Simmer and Cook:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and let it simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.</li>
                    <li>Do not stir the rice while it is cooking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Steam and Serve:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from heat. Place a clean kitchen towel under the lid and let the Plov steam for another 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Gently fluff the rice with a fork, mixing the layers of meat and vegetables with the rice.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Presentation:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transfer the Plov to a large serving dish, making sure to showcase the tender meat and vibrant carrots on top.</li>
                    <li>Serve hot, garnished with additional cumin seeds or fresh herbs if desired.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
