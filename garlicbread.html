                <p>Garlic bread is a popular and delicious accompaniment to many meals, particularly Italian dishes like pasta and pizza. It combines the rich flavors of garlic and butter with a crispy bread base, creating a savory and irresistible treat.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 loaf of French bread or Italian bread</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                    <li>Cut the loaf of bread in half horizontally.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, combine the softened butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, and a pinch of salt. Mix until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Spread the garlic butter mixture evenly over the cut sides of the bread.</li>
                    <li>If desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the buttered bread for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
                    <li>Place the bread halves on a baking sheet, cut side up.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the bread is crispy and the butter has melted.</li>
                    <li>For a crispier texture, you can broil the garlic bread for an additional 1-2 minutes, keeping a close eye to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes. Slice into individual pieces and serve warm.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For a different twist, try adding a bit of mozzarella cheese on top before baking for a cheesy garlic bread.</li>
                    <li>Feel free to experiment with herbs like basil or oregano to add more flavor.</li>
                    <li>If you prefer a more subtle garlic flavor, roast the garlic cloves before mixing them with the butter.</li>
                </ul>
